We are pleased to share that this work received the **Best Paper Award** at the *Summer Workshop on AI for Business 2025 (SWAIB 2025)* and was presented at the *China Summer Workshop on Information Management 2025 (CSWIM 2025)*.  
Most of the experiments have been completed, and we are currently drafting the manuscript. We plan to submit the paper to a top IS journal (e.g., *MIS Quarterly* or *Information Systems Research*) by the end of this year.
