Research Experience
======
*   **Research Assistant**, HKU Business School (Advisor: Prof. Jiang (Jack) Zhenhui)
    *   *Evaluation of Image Understanding Capabilities of Large Language Models in Chinese Contexts*
        *   Defined evaluation dimensions (visual perception, reasoning, aesthetics) for comprehensive image understanding assessment.
        *   Led novel dataset collection from Gaokao and university exams to ensure minimal LLM training data overlap and create a robust benchmark.
        *   Managed evaluation process: API integration, volunteer-based human evaluation, and statistical analysis for model comparison.
        *   Preliminary version has been submitted to EMNLP2025.
    *   *Evaluation of Image Generation Capabilities of Artificial Intelligence Models*
        *   Led diverse test dataset collection via questionnaires and online sources for broad coverage.
        *   Strategically selected AI models (text-to-image & multimodal LLMs like DALL-E, GPT-4o) for comprehensive comparison.
        *   Managed API-driven image generation.
        *   Orchestrated human pairwise evaluations for comparative model ranking.

Publications
======
*   **Sun, H., Xu, H., Sun, S., Li, H., & Wang, S.** (2025). Beyond Visual Appeal: Analyzing the Impact of Sensory Experience of Hotel Marketing and Review Images on Sales. *Journal of Travel Research* (ABS4).
    *   My contributions included: developing and applying computer vision to analyze visual, tactile, auditory, and olfactory sensory cues in hotel marketing and review images; analyzing the consistency of these sensory elements; and using econometric analysis to quantify their impact on hotel sales.
*   **Sun, S., Sun, H. (Co-first author), Xu, H., Li, H., & Wang, S.** (2025). Unlocking the Power of Multimodal Online Reviews: A Multisensory Perspective. *Tourism Management* (ABS4).
    *   My contributions included: developing and applying a framework that integrates machine learning and large language models for multisensory cue quantification; utilizing Poisson regression to model the influence of these cues on review usefulness.
*   **Sun, H., Xu, H., Wu, J., Sun, S., & Wang, S.** (2024). Let pictures speak: Hotel selection-recommendation method with cognitive image attribute-enhanced knowledge graphs. *International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management* (ABS3).
    *   My contributions included: implementing computer vision to extract shallow, middle, and deep cognitive features from images; designing the integration of these features within a knowledge graph; and leading the experimental validation of the model.
