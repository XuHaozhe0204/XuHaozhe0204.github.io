# üëã About Me  

Hi! I‚Äôm **Haozhe XU (ÂæêÊòäÂì≤)**, a senior undergraduate student at the [School of Management, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University](https://som.xjtu.edu.cn/en/), majoring in **Big Data Management and Application**.  

My recent research centers on **computational design science in information systems**, where I design novel deep learning algorithms that enhance both predictive and prescriptive performance, informed by behavioral insights. I apply these approaches to real-world datasets in collaboration with industry partners, with applications spanning **healthcare analytics, platform optimization, and video prediction**.  

Previously, I conducted research on **multimodal data analysis**, exploring how to extract meaningful variables from video, audio, text, and images through **natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and video/audio analytics**. These projects aimed to uncover how multimodal cues shape consumer perception, engagement, and decision-making behavior.  

Currently, I serve as a research assistant to [Prof. Zhenhui (Jack) Jiang](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/zhenhui-jack-jiang/) at the [Faculty of Business and Economics, The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/) (2024.06‚ÄìNow). I am also a member of the [HKU Business School AI Evaluation Lab](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/aimodelrankings_en/), where we deliver transparent, unbiased, and comprehensive **AI evaluation**.  

I have collaborated with multiple scholars and contributed to several research projects with:  
- [Prof. Zhenhui (Jack) Jiang](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/zhenhui-jack-jiang/) (HKU Business School)  
- [Prof. Yidong Chai](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/glxyen/info/1073/1501.htm) (Hefei University of Technology)  
- [Prof. Kan Xu](https://kanxu526.github.io/) (Arizona State University)  
- [Prof. Yang Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/0020200607) (Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University)  
- [Prof. Shaolong Sun](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/sunshaolong) (Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University)  
- [Prof. Hengyun Li](https://hengyunli.github.io/) (The Hong Kong Polytechnic University)  
- [Prof. Shouyang Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~sywang) (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)
