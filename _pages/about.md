# About Me

Hi! I’m Haozhe XU (徐昊哲), a senior undergraduate student at the [School of Management, Xi’an Jiaotong University([https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io](https://som.xjtu.edu.cn/en/)), majoring in Big Data Management and Application. My research lies at the intersection of AI and business. I design novel deep learning algorithms that enhance both predictive and prescriptive performance, informed by behavioral insights. I apply these approaches to real-world datasets in collaboration with industry partners, for example:  Healthcare prediction, Multimodal data mining (video, audio, image, text), Platform strategy optimization, Methodologically, I work with Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning & Deep Learning, Causal Inference. I am passionate about building theory-driven, data-informed solutions that bridge research and practice.
